substitute is a utility for finding and replacing text. It is meant to
behave similarly to the "s" command available in sed and other
editing tools. However, it is more atomic and less featureful than something
like sed. This quality of substitute might be useful to you. It certainly
makes its implementation easier. :)

subsitute takes a regex pattern and a replacement string. The pattern should
be a POSIX (extended) regular expression. The replacement string may contain
"\1", "\2", ..., "\9", which refer to captured submatches. It also may contain
"&", which refers to the entire matched string.

substitute is implemented in Haskell. I've tried to leverage Haskell's support
for lazy IO to make substitute a "good citizen" of unix(-like) pipelines. YMMV.

substitue is considered "under development". It may contain bugs.
